# StanfordWasteExperience
#### Conceptualized and led by Neil Nathan. Engineering and Design by Anand Upender.
An interactive site to teach incoming Stanford students about the various types of waste bins on campus and which materials are appropriate to recycle and compost.

## The Problem
California, and Stanford specifically, have many nuanced ways of throwing away or waste that new students are not always aware of. We use reusable water bottles, eat with compostable forks, and recycle as much as we can. There is currently a demand amongst administration to change our bad waste habits. Incoming students already have to complete other pre-college experiences like an alcohol safety class. However, these are not engaging and pose hypotheticals rather than applicable situations - leading to a worse pedagogical experience.

## The Solution
This experience is a prototype for a site we can send to incoming students. They will be able to drag a variety of objects into the Stanford waste bins and learn about sustainability through action.
